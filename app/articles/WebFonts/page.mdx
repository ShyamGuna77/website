# Web Fonts: From Google to Self-Hosting Like a Pro

If we want to use a font that doesn't come pre-installed on the user's device, we can download and use a custom font!

There are lots of ways to do it. In this lesson, we'll look at a couple of popular services that can help, and also see how to do it from scratch.

## Using Google Fonts

Google Fonts is an online repository of free, open-source web fonts. They have hundreds of popular options. It also effectively works as a CDN for fonts; they serve the fonts for us, from their own servers.

Google Fonts works by providing a snippet that looks like this:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@1,400;1,600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Drop this in the `<head>` of your HTML file.

Then use it in your CSS:

```css
.thing {
  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Quotes for font names">
  Web fonts should be wrapped in quotes ('Open Sans', not Open Sans). It isn't strictly required for single-word fonts, but it's good practice.
</Callout>

## No HTML file?

If you use a framework like Next.js, you may not have a traditional `index.html` file.

Frameworks generate this file automatically, but they provide escape hatches. In Next.js, you can use the `<Head />` component:

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head';

<Head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
</Head>
```

## The Benefits and Downsides of Google Fonts

<Callout type="info" title="Easy setup, but not perfect">
  Google Fonts is convenient, but not always the best for performance or variety.
</Callout>

- Lots of amazing fonts aren't on Google Fonts
- Self-hosted web fonts can perform better

[Gatsby creator Kyle Matthews discovered](https://bricolage.io/typefaces-easiest-way-to-self-host-fonts/) that self-hosting fonts can save **300ms on desktop and 1s+ on mobile 3G**.

## Performance Trade-Offs

The issue isn't Google's server speed — it's about the loading process:

1. Browser fetches and parses `index.html`
2. It sees the `<link>` to Google Fonts CSS, fetches it
3. Parses that CSS, sees font reference to `fonts.gstatic.com`, fetches it too

Because fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com are **external domains**, additional handshakes (like HTTPS) introduce overhead.

<Callout type="warning" title="Blocking requests hurt performance">
  The font CSS request is **blocking** — the browser waits before rendering the page.
</Callout>

Self-hosting lets you skip Step 2 and 3 entirely, resulting in better performance.

In the past, fonts from Google Fonts might've been cached due to global CDN sharing. However, modern browsers now use **partitioned caches**, so every site must re-download fonts.

## Using Modern Tooling: Fontsource

[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org) by Vercel makes it easy to self-host fonts. You can install fonts using npm:

```bash
npm install @fontsource/open-sans
```

Then import it directly:

```js
import '@fontsource/open-sans';
```

<Callout type="info" title="Fontsource FTW">
  Fontsource supports all Google Fonts and other open-source fonts, ideal for modern JS frameworks.
</Callout>

Angular 11+ also supports Google Fonts with built-in configuration to inline fonts directly.

## The Manual Way

If the font isn’t on Google Fonts or Fontsource, self-host manually.

### Converting formats

Most system fonts are `.otf` or `.ttf` — large and not optimized for web. Convert them to `.woff2` using [Font Squirrel’s Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).

### Using `@font-face`

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src: url('/fonts/wotfard-regular.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Repeat for each weight and style:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src: url('/fonts/wotfard-medium.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 500;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src: url('/fonts/wotfard-bold.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src: url('/fonts/wotfard-regular-italic.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Each variation (italic, weight) requires its own declaration.

### IE Support

Modern browsers all support `.woff2`. IE doesn’t.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  src: 
    url('/fonts/wotfard-regular-italic.woff2') format('woff2'),
    url('/fonts/wotfard-regular-italic.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

Put `.woff2` first so modern browsers use the smaller file.

## Where to Place the Fonts

Add `@font-face` declarations inside `<style>` in your `index.html` or in your main CSS file.

```html
<style>
  @font-face {
    font-family: 'Wotfard';
    src: url('/fonts/wotfard-regular.woff2') format('woff2');
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
  }
</style>
```

Use like this:

```css
.something {
  font-family: 'Wotfard';
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

## Static Files in React

React requires assets like fonts/images to go in the `public/` folder (CRA) or static handling paths for frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby.

## Faux Bolds and Italics

Without the real bold or italic font, browsers will **simulate** styles. These look worse than true variants.

**True Bold** – Clean and designed by the font creator.

**Faux Bold** – Lines artificially thickened by the browser.

Same goes for italic: browsers slant the font instead of using alternate characters.

<Callout type="warning" title="Use real styles">
  Always provide actual bold/italic font files. Faux styles reduce visual quality.
</Callout>

## Number Rounding

Suppose you load 400 and 900 weights. What happens when you write:

```css
.thing {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.thing {
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

In the past, this would result in faux-bold. But modern browsers round to the closest available weight.

<Callout type="info" title="Demo Outcome">
  The font will round to 900, showing heavy text for both weights.
</Callout>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Using <code>font-weight: bold</code></th>
      <th>Using <code>font-weight: 700</code></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>This text is bold.</td>
      <td>This text is bold.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout type="tip" title="Use numeric weights for clarity">
  Use `font-weight: 700` instead of `bold` for better control and precision.
</Callout>

## Final Thoughts

- Google Fonts is simple, but may be slower
- Self-hosted fonts are faster and more customizable
- Fontsource makes self-hosting even easier
- Always use proper formats (`.woff2`, `.woff`)
- Avoid faux styles — real bold/italic files make a difference
