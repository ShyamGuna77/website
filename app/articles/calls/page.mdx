Let’s explore  CSS Grid mental model — one that helped me finally understand layout properly. This blog uses callouts to emphasize core ideas and common pitfalls.

---

## Think of Grid as a Canvas, Not a Table

Grid isn't just rows and columns. It's more like a flexible, invisible canvas where you draw **lines** that content snaps to.

<Callout type="tip" title="Visualize it like graph paper">
  Instead of thinking in terms of "columns", think in terms of **grid lines**. Items are placed between these lines.
</Callout>

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 100px;
}
```

This creates 3 columns — but also 4 vertical grid lines.

---

## Items Don’t Automatically Fill Cells

A common misconception is that items automatically fall into "cells". But grid items are **placed between lines**.

```css
.item {
  grid-column: 2 / 4;
}
```

This places the item from line 2 up to (but not including) line 4.

<Callout type="warning" title="Be mindful of the lines">
  `grid-column: 2 / 4` means start at line 2, end before line 4 — **not** columns 2 to 4.
</Callout>

---

## Implicit vs. Explicit Grids

Grid will auto-create rows or columns when needed — these are **implicit tracks**.

<Callout type="info" title="Explicit vs Implicit?">
  An explicit grid is defined by you. Implicit tracks are created when content spills over the declared grid.
</Callout>

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}

.item {
  grid-row: 5;
}
```

Even if you didn’t define 5 rows, Grid will create them.

## Named Lines for Better Readability

You can name your lines to make your layout easier to read and maintain.

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: [start] 1fr [middle] 2fr [end];
}

.item {
  grid-column: start / middle;
}
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Cleaner code with named lines">
  Naming your lines adds semantics to your layout and makes it easier to manage at scale.
</Callout>

---

## Never Do This

<Callout type="danger" title="Avoid this trap!">
  Don’t rely on content order or guess where items will fall — explicitly place them using `grid-column` and `grid-row`.
</Callout>

```css
/* ❌ Bad Practice */
.item {
  grid-column: span 2;
}
```

---

## Final Thoughts

The Grid mental model helps you:

- Visualize layouts before writing code
- Understand implicit behavior
- Write more intentional, maintainable CSS
