Every morning I wake up, and what's the first thing I do? I open my phone. No thought, no intention just instinct. Instagram. Reddit. Telegram. Twitter. One after the other, like some programmed robot.  I often wonder when did I stop owning my time and start surrendering it to a glowing screen?

We talk about productivity, goals, and balance—but the reality is most of us are caught in a cycle. The moment we’re free, even for a second, our hands reach out to a screen. We scroll,scroll until our battery run's out.

 ### Fear of missing out.

<div className="callout callout-warning">
  <div className="callout-title">⚠️ FOMO Has Us By the Throat</div>
  There’s this invisible pressure to be in the loop, to know everything.  
  Stories feel like homework. Reels feel like therapy.  
  Memes are conversations now.

  And if you’re not constantly checking your feed? You feel behind.   
  You feel like you’re missing something critical even when you know it’s all noise.
</div>

## Welcome to the Spiral

Let’s be honest **Instagram** is a carefully curated fantasy. Reels are addictive. They’re short, addictive, and reward you for doing nothing.You know whatever zuck touches he destroys it.  Reddit feels better at first because it's ‘informative’, but it still keeps you stuck in the loop. The moment you stumble into groups like r/OffMyChestIndia, it’s game over. Suddenly, your feed is a nonstop stream of hatred, cheating stories, and enough misinformation that ruins your mood for the day.

The only apps I have a sliver of respect for is **Twitter** (X, whatever you want to call it) and **Telegram**. These are  one of the few platforms that actually helps me discover new tech, motivating builds, and interesting work from people around the globe. Seeing other people grind and watching their projects push me even more
 
It’s where I stumble across cool tech, smart builders, and real ambition.  
Sometimes, it even motivates me… but only for a moment.


## JIO WAS A MISTAKE ##
<div className="callout callout-danger">
  <div className="callout-title">🔥 Cheap Internet, Expensive Attention</div>
  Let’s talk about the elephant in the Indian room: **Jio**. While it revolutionized internet accessibility, it also unleashed a storm. With dirt-cheap data, the entire country dove headfirst into a digital swamp. Students, especially, got trapped in an endless cycle of scroll-scroll-scroll-repeat. That’s amazing. But it also did something darker.It made distraction too easy.
  Now you’ve got 13-year-olds addicted to reels, 16-year-olds chasing fame, 20-year-olds stuck in loops they can’t name.    
 
  We’re not just scrolling—we’re sinking.

  And honestly? We’ve forgotten how to focus.
</div>

This is a quote by some  dude

> “**Show me the heroes that the youth of your country look up to, and I will tell you the future of your country.**”

Who are we idolizing now?  

Pranksters. psuedo feminists. Rich-kid-wannabes. People doing nothing and getting everything.

These days, fame is practically on sale. Flash a cute face, strike a pose, and boom, you’ve got simps lining up in your DMs. Some just toss a bit of cleavage into the mix and suddenly they're influencers, earning more in a week than doctors or scientists do in a month. Who needs a PhD when you've got the algorithm on your side?

We’re idolizing hollow personalities, not thinkers, not builders, not leaders. 
  

## My Doomscrolling Pattern

I’m not preaching from a pedestal. I’m right there with you. Every time I’m free, my thumb automatically opens an app—no decision, no thought.

I know it’s hurting my attention. I feel it when I try to study, read, or even sit still. But still I do it. Over and over.

Sometimes I wonder, what am I even looking for?

## What Now ?

I don’t have all the answers. Maybe you do. Maybe you’ve broken the cycle or at least cracked it.

If you’ve found a strategy that works, please share it. Help someone like me.

<div className="callout callout-tip">
  <div className="callout-title">✅ Trying to Claw My Way Out</div>
  I don’t have a perfect system. But here’s what I’m trying:

  - Phone out of reach when I’m working  
  - Using Twitter intentionally for ideas, not drama  
  - Reading real books (not feeds)  
  - cutting off Instagram 
  - Spending more time… offline
</div>

I’m writing this now as a reflection. A mirror. A warning. A note to my future self

## Six months after 

I’ll write a follow-up to this. Either I’ll tell you how I broke free, or how I fell deeper.

Until then, if you're reading this and feeling the same, know this: you're not alone.

Let’s try, fail, try again—together.

But no matter what—  
**I’ll be honest.**
