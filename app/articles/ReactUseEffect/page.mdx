React 18 brings a lot of new goodies, but what causes a lot of head-scratching is how components using `useEffect` seem to mount and unmount **twice** during development â€” specifically in **StrictMode**.

<Callout type="info" title="This is intended behavior">
  React intentionally double-invokes certain lifecycle methods in development to
  help surface bugs related to mounting and unmounting. It **does not** happen
  in production.
</Callout>

Repeat after me:

- It's not going to be there during production
- It helps discover bugs in mounting/unmounting during development
- Dan Abramov said it's cool. And Dan is cool. ðŸ˜Ž

## React 18 double rendering with empty dependency array

So what happens when you do this?

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`I'm mounting!`);
    return () => console.log(`And now I'm unmounting`);
  }, []);

  return <h1>Hello SPD Readers!</h1>;
}
```

Youâ€™ll see this output twice in development. Why? Because React simulates a mount/unmount/remount cycle.

<Callout type="tip" title="React is stress-testing your component">
  This helps ensure your component doesnâ€™t break when mounted and unmounted
  quickly, like in route transitions.
</Callout>

## Want to turn it off?

You technically can â€” but you shouldnâ€™t.

```js
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  // <StrictMode>
  <App />
  // </StrictMode>
);
```

<Callout type="danger" title="Don't do this in real projects">
  Removing `<StrictMode>` just to avoid double renders defeats the purpose of development safety checks.
</Callout>

## How to fetch data correctly in React 18

Fetching data in `useEffect` without a framework or a cache? You might see double requests. Hereâ€™s what Dan Abramov recommends:

<Callout type="info" title="Use framework-level data fetching">
  If you're using a framework (like Next.js or Remix) , leverage their data
  loading mechanisms. They decouple rendering from fetching.
</Callout>

If youâ€™re not using a framework:

- Use a client caching library (e.g., React Query, Apollo)
- Avoid raw `useEffect` data fetching if possible

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();

  fetch("/api/data", { signal: controller.signal })
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(setData);

  return () => controller.abort();
}, []);
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Double fetch is harmless if you cache">
  With client caching, re-fetching doesnâ€™t result in broken behavior or wasted
  performance.
</Callout>

---

## In summary

- Double mount/unmount in dev is **intentional** with StrictMode
- It helps catch bugs earlier in development
- Only happens in **development**, not production
- Use the right tool for data fetching (framework or cache)

<Callout type="tip" title="React is a library, not a framework">
  Youâ€™re responsible for picking the right tools around React. React Query or
  RTK Query are great for data fetching.
</Callout>
